        PAOK FC (Greek: ΠΑΕ ΠΑΟΚ, Πανθεσσαλονίκειος Αθλητικός Όμιλος
        Κωνσταντινουπολιτών, Panthessaloníkios Athlitikós Ómilos
        Konstadinoupolitón, "Pan-Thessalonian Athletic Club of
        Constantinopolitans"), commonly known as PAOK Thessaloniki or simply
        PAOK, is a Greek professional football club based in Thessaloniki,
        Macedonia. PAOK are one of the top domestic clubs, the most widely
        supported in Northern Greece and with the third largest fanbase in the
        country, according to the latest polls and researches. A research by
        Marca in August 2018, reported that PAOK are the most popular Greek
        football team on social media.

        Established on 20 April 1926 by Greek refugees who fled to Thessaloniki
        from Constantinople in the wake of the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922),
        they play their home games at Toumba Stadium, a 29,000 seating capacity
        football ground. Their name, along with the club's emblem, the
        Byzantine-style double-headed eagle with retracted wings, honours the
        memory of the people and places (mostly from the city of Constantinople)
        that once belonged to the Eastern Roman Empire. PAOK currently plays in
        the top-flight Super League, which they have won three times (in 1976,
        1985 and 2019). They are eight-time winners of the Greek Cup (in 1972,
        1974, 2001, 2003, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2021). The club is one of the
        three which have never been relegated from the top national division and
        the only team in Greece that have won the Double (in 2019) going
        unbeaten (26–4–0 record) in a national round-robin league tournament
        (league format since 1959).

        The team has appeared several times in the UEFA Europa League, but has
        yet to reach the group stage of the UEFA Champions League. PAOK have
        reached twice the quarter-finals of a European competition, in the
        1973–74 European Cup Winners' Cup and in the inaugural 2021–22 UEFA
        Europa Conference League. PAOK is the only Greek team that has more wins
        than losses in their European record (89 wins, 65 draws and 76 defeats,
        as of 14 December 2023) and the 0–7 away UEFA Cup win over Locomotive
        Tbilisi on 16 September 1999 is the largest ever achieved by a Greek
        football club in all European competitions.
